# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004). 

Jones et al (1999) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental-sclae measurements have not previously been made. 

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which
measurements in the lit can be applied.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as the are transported
away from the source region.

# Methodology
We compared something. 
The model is detailed in Smith et all 2002.
