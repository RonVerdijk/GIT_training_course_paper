# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004). 

Jones et al (1999) conducted several studies in this region,
but continental-sclae measurements have not previously been made. 

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which
measurements in the lit can be applied.
